# A working chat room.

This project is from the Fourth Semester Fullstack course. This is the class course project with my own twist.

## Features to come by priority (OR NOT).

```python
- Chatroom should have pictures.
- Beautification of the chatroom.
- Rework of the edit/delete button.
- Chatroom should have emojis.
- A sort of profile. (Rework signup).
- Private chatting.
```
